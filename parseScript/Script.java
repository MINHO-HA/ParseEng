			"You mean, You-Know-Who is out there|right now in the Forest?\r\n" + 
			"But he's weak.|He's living off the unicorns.\r\n" + 
			"Don't you see? We had it wrong.\r\n" + 
			"Snape doesn't want the Stone for himself.|He wants it for Voldemort.\r\n" + 
			"With the Elixir of Life,|Voldemort will be strong again.\r\n" + 
			"He'll come back.\r\n" + 
			"But if he comes back...\r\n" + 
			"...you don't think he'll try|to kill you, do you?\r\n" + 
			"If he'd had the chance,|he might have tried tonight.\r\n" + 
			"And to think I've been worrying|about my Potions final.\r\n" + 
			"Hang on a minute.|We're forgetting one thing.\r\n" + 
			"Who's the one wizard|Voldemort always feared?\r\n" + 
			"Dumbledore. As long as Dumbledore|is around, Harry, you're safe.\r\n" + 
			"As long as Dumbledore is around,|you can't be touched.\r\n" + 
			"I'd heard Hogwarts' final exams were|frightful, but I found that enjoyable.\r\n" + 
			"Speak for yourself.|All right there, Harry?\r\n" + 
			"- My scar. It keeps burning.|- It's happened before.\r\n" + 
			"- Not like this.|- You should see the nurse.\r\n" + 
			"I think it's a warning.|It means danger's coming.\r\n" + 
			"- Of course!|- What is it?\r\n" + 
			"Isn't it odd that what Hagrid wants|more than anything is a dragon...\r\n" + 
			"...and a stranger just happens|to have one?\r\n" + 
			"How many people wander around|with dragon eggs?\r\n" + 
			"Why didn't I see it before?\r\n" + 
			"Who gave you the egg?|What did he look like?\r\n" + 
			"I never saw his face.|He kept his hood up.\r\n" + 
			"You and this stranger|must have talked.\r\n" + 
			"He wanted to know what sort|of creatures I looked after.\r\n" + 
			"I said, \"After Fluffy,|a dragon's gonna be no problem\".\r\n" + 
			"- Was he interested in Fluffy?|- Of course he was interested.\r\n" + 
			"How often do you come across|a three-headed dog?\r\n" + 
			"But I told him, \"The trick with any beast|is to know how to calm him\".\r\n" + 
			"Take Fluffy, for example. Play him|music and he falls straight to sleep.\r\n" + 
			"I shouldn't have told you that.\r\n" + 
			"Where are you going?\r\n" + 
			"We have to see Dumbledore.|Immediately!\r\n" + 
			"I'm afraid he's not here.\r\n" + 
			"He received an urgent owl|from the Ministry of Magic and left.\r\n" + 
			"He's gone?|But this is important!\r\n" + 
			"This is about the Philosopher's Stone!\r\n" + 
			"- How do you know...?|- Someone's going to try and steal it.\r\n" + 
			"I don't know how you know,|but I assure you it is well protected.\r\n" + 
			"Now would you go back|to your dormitories? Quietly.\r\n" + 
			"That was no stranger Hagrid met.|It was Snape.\r\n" + 
			"Which means he knows|how to get past Fluffy.\r\n" + 
			"- And with Dumbledore gone...|- Good afternoon.\r\n" + 
			"What would three young Gryffindors...\r\n" + 
			"...be doing inside on a day like this?\r\n" + 
			"- We were just...|- You ought to be careful.\r\n" + 
			"People will think you're...\r\n" + 
			"...up to something.\r\n" + 
			"Now what do we do?\r\n" + 
			"We go down the trap door. Tonight.\r\n" + 
			"Trevor.\r\n" + 
			"Trevor, go! You shouldn't be here!\r\n" + 
			"Neither should you.|You're sneaking out again, aren't you?\r\n" + 
			"- Neville, listen. We were...|- No, I won't let you!\r\n" + 
			"You'll get Gryffindor into trouble again.|I'll fight you.\r\n" + 
			"Petrificus Totalus.\r\n" + 
			"You're a little scary sometimes,|you know that?\r\n" + 
			"Brilliant, but scary.\r\n" + 
			"Let's go.\r\n" + 
			"- Sorry.|- It's for your own good, you know.\r\n" + 
			"- You stood on my foot!|- Sorry.\r\n" + 
			"Alohomora.\r\n" + 
			"Wait a minute. He's...\r\n" + 
			"...snoring.\r\n" + 
			"Snape's already been here.|He's put a spell on the harp.\r\n" + 
			"It's got horrible breath.\r\n" + 
			"- We have to move its paw.|- What?\r\n" + 
			"Come on!\r\n" + 
			"Okay. Push.\r\n" + 
			"I'll go first. Don't follow|until I give you a sign.\r\n" + 
			"If something bad happens,|get yourselves out.\r\n" + 
			"Does it seem a bit quiet to you?\r\n" + 
			"The harp.\r\n" + 
			"It's stopped playing.\r\n" + 
			"Jump!\r\n" + 
			"Lucky this plant thing's here, really.\r\n" + 
			"Stop moving, both of you.|This is Devil's Snare.\r\n" + 
			"You have to relax. If you don't,|it will only kill you faster.\r\n" + 
			"Kill us faster?|Oh, now I can relax!\r\n" + 
			"Hermione!\r\n" + 
			"- Now what are we gonna do?|- Just relax!\r\n" + 
			"- Hermione, where are you?|- Do what I say! Trust me.\r\n" + 
			"- Are you okay?|- Yeah, I'm fine.\r\n" + 
			"- He's not relaxing, is he?|- Apparently not.\r\n" + 
			"- We've gotta do something.|- What?\r\n" + 
			"I remember reading something|in Herbology.\r\n" + 
			"Devil's Snare, Devil's Snare.|It's deadly fun...\r\n" + 
			"...but will sulk in the sun!|That's it! It hates sunlight.\r\n" + 
			"Lumus Solem.\r\n" + 
			"- Ron, you okay?|- Yeah.\r\n" + 
			"Lucky we didn't panic.\r\n" + 
			"Lucky Hermione pays attention|in Herbology.\r\n" + 
			"What is that?\r\n" + 
			"I don't know. Sounds like wings.\r\n" + 
			"Curious. I've never seen|birds like these.\r\n" + 
			"They're not birds.|They're keys.\r\n" + 
			"And I'll bet one of them|fits that door.\r\n" + 
			"- What's this all about?|- I don't know.\r\n" + 
			"Strange.\r\n" + 
			"\"Alohomora!\"\r\n" + 
			"Well, it was worth a try.\r\n" + 
			"What will we do?|There must be a thousand keys.\r\n" + 
			"We want a big, old-fashioned one.|Probably rusty.\r\n" + 
			"I see it!|The one with the broken wing.\r\n" + 
			"What's wrong?\r\n" + 
			"It's too simple.\r\n" + 
			"Go on! If Snape could catch it|on that old broomstick, you can.\r\n" + 
			"You're the youngest Seeker|in a century.\r\n" + 
			"This complicates things a bit.\r\n" + 
			"Catch the key!\r\n" + 
			"Hurry up!\r\n" + 
			"I don't like this.|I don't like this at all.\r\n" + 
			"Where are we? A graveyard.\r\n" + 
			"This is no graveyard.\r\n" + 
			"It's a chessboard.\r\n" + 
			"There's the door.\r\n" + 
			"Now what do we do?\r\n" + 
			"It's obvious, isn't it? We've got|to play our way across the room.\r\n" + 
			"Harry, you take|the empty bishop's square.\r\n" + 
			"Hermione, you'll be|the queen-side castle.\r\n" + 
			"As for me, I'll be a knight.\r\n" + 
			"What happens now?\r\n" + 
			"Well, white moves first.\r\n" + 
			"And then...\r\n" + 
			"...we play.\r\n" + 
			"Ron, you don't suppose|this is going to be like...\r\n" + 
			"...real wizard's chess, do you?\r\n" + 
			"You there, d5.\r\n" + 
			"Yes, Hermione.\r\n" + 
			"I think this is gonna be|exactly like wizard's chess.\r\n" + 
			"Castle to e4!\r\n" + 
			"Pawn to c3!\r\n" + 
			"- Wait a minute.|- You understand right, Harry.\r\n" + 
			"Once I make my move,|the queen will take me.\r\n" + 
			"Then you're free to check the king.\r\n" + 
			"- No. Ron, no!|- What is it?\r\n" + 
			"- He's going to sacrifice himself.|- No, there must be another way!\r\n" + 
			"Do you wanna stop Snape|from getting that Stone or not?\r\n" + 
			"Harry, it's you that has to go on.|I know it.\r\n" + 
			"Not me. Not Hermione. You.\r\n" + 
			"Knight to h3.\r\n" + 
			"Check.\r\n" + 
			"Ron!\r\n" + 
			"No, don't move!|Don't forget, we're still playing.\r\n" + 
			"Checkmate.\r\n" + 
			"Take care of Ron.|Then go to the owlery.\r\n" + 
			"Send a message to Dumbledore.|Ron's right.\r\n" + 
			"I have to go on.\r\n" + 
			"You'll be okay, Harry.|You're a great wizard. You really are.\r\n" + 
			"Not as good as you.\r\n" + 
			"Me? Books and cleverness.|There are more important things.\r\n" + 
			"Friendship and bravery.|And, Harry, just be careful.\r\n" + 
			"You?\r\n" + 
			"No, it can't be.|Snape, he was the...\r\n" + 
			"Yes, he does seem the type,|doesn't he?\r\n" + 
			"Next to him, who would suspect...\r\n" + 
			"...poor, stuttering|Professor Quirrell?\r\n" + 
			"But that day, during the Quidditch match,|Snape tried to kill me.\r\n" + 
			"No, dear boy. I tried to kill you!\r\n" + 
			"If Snape's cloak hadn't caught|fire and broken my eye contact...\r\n" + 
			"...I would have succeeded.\r\n" + 
			"Even with Snape muttering|his countercurse.\r\n" + 
			"Snape was trying to save me?\r\n" + 
			"I knew you were a danger to me,|especially after Halloween.\r\n" + 
			"- Then you let the troll in!|- Very good, Potter, yes.\r\n" + 
			"Snape, unfortunately, wasn't fooled.\r\n" + 
			"While everyone ran about,|he went to the third floor to head me off.\r\n" + 
			"He, of course, never trusted me again.\r\n" + 
			"He rarely left me alone.|But he doesn't understand.\r\n" + 
			"I'm never alone. Never.\r\n" + 
			"Now, what does this mirror do?\r\n" + 
			"I see what I desire.\r\n" + 
			"I see myself holding the Stone.|But how do I get it?\r\n" + 
			"Use the boy.\r\n" + 
			"Come here, Potter! Now!\r\n" + 
			"Tell me, what do you see?\r\n" + 
			"What is it? What do you see?\r\n" + 
			"I'm shaking hands with Dumbledore.|I've won the house cup.\r\n" + 
			"He lies.\r\n" + 
			"Tell the truth! What do you see?\r\n" + 
			"- Let me speak to him.|- Master, you are not strong enough.\r\n" + 
			"I have strength enough for this.\r\n" + 
			"Harry Potter...\r\n" + 
			"...we meet again.\r\n" + 
			"Voldemort.\r\n" + 
			"Yes. You see what I've become?\r\n" + 
			"See what I must do to survive?\r\n" + 
			"Live off another. A mere parasite.\r\n" + 
			"Unicorn blood can sustain me...\r\n" + 
			"...but it cannot give me|a body of my own.\r\n" + 
			"But there is something that can.\r\n" + 
			"Something that, conveniently enough,|lies in your pocket.\r\n" + 
			"Stop him!\r\n" + 
			"Don't be a fool.\r\n" + 
			"Why suffer an horrific death...\r\n" + 
			"...when you can join me and live?\r\n" + 
			"Never!\r\n" + 
			"Bravery. Your parents had it too.\r\n" + 
			"Tell me, Harry...\r\n" + 
			"...would you like to see|your mother and father again?\r\n" + 
			"Together...\r\n" + 
			"...we can bring them back.\r\n" + 
			"All I ask is for something in return.\r\n" + 
			"That's it, Harry.\r\n" + 
			"There is no good and evil.\r\n" + 
			"There is only power...\r\n" + 
			"...and those too weak to seek it.\r\n" + 
			"Together, we'll do|extraordinary things.\r\n" + 
			"Just give me the Stone!\r\n" + 
			"You liar!\r\n" + 
			"Kill him!\r\n" + 
			"- What is this magic?|- Fool, get the Stone!\r\n" + 
			"Good afternoon, Harry.\r\n" + 
			"- Tokens from your admirers?|- Admirers?\r\n" + 
			"What happened in the dungeons between|you and Professor Quirrell is a secret.\r\n" + 
			"So, naturally, the whole school knows.\r\n" + 
			"I see that your friend Ronald|has saved you the trouble...\r\n" + 
			"...of opening your Chocolate Frogs.\r\n" + 
			"Ron was here? Is he all right?|What about Hermione?\r\n" + 
			"Fine. They're both just fine.\r\n" + 
			"- What happened to the Stone?|- Relax, dear boy.\r\n" + 
			"The Stone has been destroyed.\r\n" + 
			"My friend Nicholas and I|have had a little chat...\r\n" + 
			"...and agreed it was best all around.\r\n" + 
			"But then, Flamel,|he'll die, won't he?\r\n" + 
			"He has enough Elixir|to set his affairs in order.\r\n" + 
			"But yes, he will die.\r\n" + 
			"How is it I got the Stone, sir?\r\n" + 
			"One minute I was staring|in the mirror and...\r\n" + 
			"You see, only a person...\r\n" + 
			"...who wanted to find the Stone,|find it...\r\n" + 
			"...but not use it,|would be able to get it.\r\n" + 
			"That is one of my more brilliant ideas.\r\n" + 
			"And between you and me,|that is saying something.\r\n" + 
			"Does that mean, with the Stone gone,|that Voldemort can never come back?\r\n" + 
			"I'm afraid...\r\n" + 
			"...there are ways|in which he can return.\r\n" + 
			"Harry, do you know why...\r\n" + 
			"...Professor Quirrell couldn't bear|to have you touch him?\r\n" + 
			"It was because of your mother.|She sacrificed herself for you.\r\n" + 
			"And that kind of act leaves a mark.\r\n" + 
			"No, this kind of mark cannot be seen.\r\n" + 
			"- It lives in your very skin.|- What is it?\r\n" + 
			"Love, Harry. Love.\r\n" + 
			"Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Beans.\r\n" + 
			"I was most unfortunate in my youth|to come across a vomit-flavored one.\r\n" + 
			"And since then,|I've lost my liking for them.\r\n" + 
			"But I think I could be safe...\r\n" + 
			"...with a nice toffee.\r\n" + 
			"Alas!\r\n" + 
			"Earwax.\r\n" + 
			"- All right there, Ron?|- All right. You?\r\n" + 
			"All right. Hermione?\r\n" + 
			"Never better.\r\n" + 
			"Another year gone.\r\n" + 
			"And now, as I understand it,|the house cup needs awarding.\r\n" + 
			"And the points stand thus:\r\n" + 
			"In fourth place,|Gryffindor with 312 points.\r\n" + 
			"Third place,|Hufflepuff with 352 points.\r\n" + 
			"In second place...\r\n" + 
			"...Ravenclaw with 426 points.\r\n" + 
			"And in first place...\r\n" + 
			"...with 472 points, Slytherin house.\r\n" + 
			"Nice one, mate.\r\n" + 
			"Yes, well done, Slytherin.|Well done.\r\n" + 
			"However, recent events must|be taken into account.\r\n" + 
			"And I have a few last-minute points|to award.\r\n" + 
			"To Miss Hermione Granger,|for the cool use of intellect...\r\n" + 
			"...while others were in grave peril...\r\n" + 
			"...50 points.\r\n" + 
			"Good job.\r\n" + 
			"Second, to Mr. Ronald Weasley,|for the best-played game of chess...\r\n" + 
			"...that Hogwarts has seen|these many years, 50 points.\r\n" + 
			"And third...\r\n" + 
			"...to Mr. Harry Potter...\r\n" + 
			"...for pure nerve|and outstanding courage...\r\n" + 
			"...I award Gryffindor house 60 points.\r\n" + 
			"We're tied with Slytherin!\r\n" + 
			"Finally, it takes a great deal of bravery|to stand up to your enemies...\r\n" + 
			"...but a great deal more|to stand up to your friends.\r\n" + 
			"I award 10 points...\r\n" + 
			"...to Neville Longbottom.\r\n" + 
			"Assuming that my calculations|are correct...\r\n" + 
			"...I believe that a change|of decoration is in order.\r\n" + 
			"Gryffindor wins the house cup.\r\n" + 
			"Come on, now.|Hurry up, you'll be late.\r\n" + 
			"Train's leaving. Go on.|Come on, hurry up.\r\n" + 
			"- Come on, Harry.|- One minute.\r\n" + 
			"Thought you were leaving|without saying goodbye, did you?\r\n" + 
			"This is for you.\r\n" + 
			"Thanks, Hagrid.\r\n" + 
			"Go on. On with you. On with you now.|Oh, listen, Harry.\r\n" + 
			"If that dolt of a cousin of yours,|Dudley, gives you any grief...\r\n" + 
			"...you could always threaten him...\r\n" + 
			"...with a nice pair of ears|to go with his tail.\r\n" + 
			"But we're not allowed to do magic|away from Hogwarts. You know that.\r\n" + 
			"I do. But your cousin don't, do he?\r\n" + 
			"Feels strange to be going home,|doesn't it?\r\n" + 
			"I'm not going home.\r\n" + 
			"Not really.";
